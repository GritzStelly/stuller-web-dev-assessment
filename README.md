My front-end web designer assessment for Stuller, LLC

Hello Stuller team. Please see my web dev assessment in this github repo. Download the entire repo and view the file named "index.html"
I have included two versions of my main.css file, with the main.min.css file being the minified version of the css, and the main.css being the original css file with all of my comments

You can also find my working codepen that I used for the initial planning of this document here:

A few notes on my design, it is probably apparent to you that this is my very first time using bootstrap. Some regrets I have were:
* I could not get the anchor to link the entire div for the quick links. There were formatting issues (or maybe understanding issues) when trying to wrap the quick-link divs with an anchor link. I had planned on using the bootstrap utility for Stretch Link, but this did not behave exactly as I intended either so I opted for simply display the text as a link, which is less than ideal for responsive web design
* You will likely notice a lot of forced styles, especially when considering the footer, header, and especially social icons
* I was not able to implement Adobe TypeKit, as I do not personally have an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. I have included font families for the appropriate fonts used in the design if you happen to have them installed locally, however I also included fallback families in the case that you do not have these fonts installed.
