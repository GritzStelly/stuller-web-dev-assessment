# Stuller Web Dev Assessment

This repository contains my front-end web development project, a website built from scratch as part of a technical assessment. The primary challenge was to replicate a provided PNG image as a fully functional, responsive webpage.

### The Challenge
The core requirements of this project were to:
* Build a responsive webpage based **solely on a single PNG image**.
* **Manually extract all assets** (images, icons, colors, fonts) from the provided image, as no editable project files (like a PSD) were supplied.
* Utilize **Bootstrap** as the foundational framework.
* Deliver a complete and functional website.

This project was a great exercise in attention to detail, resourcefulness, and implementing a new framework under a strict set of constraints.

### The Development Process
This project was an opportunity for me to learn and apply Bootstrap for the first time. The final result reflects a significant amount of problem-solving to overcome challenges, including:
* **Replicating the design without editable assets.** This involved meticulous work to match colors, sizes, and spacing to the original PNG file.
* **Working with Bootstrap's grid system.** While powerful, integrating the layout required careful attention to classes and responsive behavior.
* **Creating interactive elements.** I was unable to get the entire "quick link" divs to function as a clickable anchor link without causing formatting issues. I intended to use Bootstrap's **Stretch Link** utility for this, but opted for a simpler text link to ensure the site's functionality.

### Project Files
* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
* `main.css`: The original CSS file with comments explaining my design choices and adjustments.
* `main.min.css`: A minified version of the CSS file for optimized performance.

**Note on Fonts:** The project intended to use a specific font from Adobe TypeKit. As I do not have a Creative Cloud subscription, the design uses fallback fonts. If you have the specified fonts installed locally, the site's appearance may differ slightly.
