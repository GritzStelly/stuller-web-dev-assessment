# stuller-web-dev-assessment
My front-end web designer assessment for Stuller, LLC

Hello Stuller team. Please see my web dev assessment in this github repo. Download the entire repo and view the file named "index.html"
I have included two versions of my main.css file, with the main.min.css file being the minified version of the css, and the main.css being the original css file with all of my comments

You can also find my working codepen that I used for the initial planning of this document here:
